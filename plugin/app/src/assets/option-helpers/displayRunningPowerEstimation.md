Display a running power estimation of your running activities. This estimation can be compared with cycling power (in watts) for a given running pace: especially useful for triathletes.  

- Only works on **your** running activities which don't have any power data mapped to strava. (FYI: Real running power data coming from sensors like "Stryd" are no longer mapped in strava activities)
  
- Make sure to **setup your weight** properly in athlete settings
