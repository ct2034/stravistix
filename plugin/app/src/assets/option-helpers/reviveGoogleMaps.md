Unfortunately strava has discontinued Google Maps inside the web version to use "MapBox + OpenStreetMap" maps.  

This option allows you revive Google Maps and Street view features with an orange button placed near Strava native maps.  

_Note: This feature is currently working only on activity pages at the moment._
