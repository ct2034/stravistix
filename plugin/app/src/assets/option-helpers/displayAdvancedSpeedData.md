# Quartiles and median
---
This option adds new speed/pace data to your activity panel.

For understanding these indicators, we assume that 0% to 100% are all the speeds/paces sorted ascending you obtained during an activity.
  
- 25% Quartile: This indicator represents the speed/pace you maintained at the position "25%". This is commonly called "Lower quartile" or Q1.  
- 50% Median: This indicator represents the speed/pace you maintained at the position "50%". It's simply the median...  
- 75% Quartile: This indicator represents the speed/pace you maintained at the position "75%". This is commonly called "Upper quartile" or Q3.  

_These indicators can be more meaning full than average speed/pace itself to analyse activity speed/pace. For example, you upload an activity in which you ride pretty fast for a long time. Then, you expect to have a good average speed. Unfortunately, you have to go through the city to go home where many red lights and cars behavior slow you down. Your average speed/pace then drops very quickly and do not highlight your effort of "riding fast". In this example, the 75% quartile speed/pace is representative of the effort you made (eliminating slow speeds/paces associated with the cross of the city)._  

# Standard Deviation Speed/Pace Ïƒ
---
This indicator represents the amount of variation or dispersion of speeds/paces from your average speed/pace. It gives a good estimation of how your ride was paced (like variability index). From a mathematical view, this is the square root of the variance computed through this formula (_X is speed/pace_):
> $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n{(x_i - \mu)^2}},~~~~where~~\mu = \frac{1}{n}\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}$
