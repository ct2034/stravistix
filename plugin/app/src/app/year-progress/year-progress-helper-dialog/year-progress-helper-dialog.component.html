		<h3 class="mat-title">What is the purpose of this feature?</h3>
		This feature allows you to evaluate a progress of your choice (distance, time, ...) from the beginning of a year
		to a specific day of that year. And compare it to previous years. Let's take an example: Today is
		{{todayMoment.format("MMM Do")}}. So the feature will reply to the following question:<br/><br/>
		<i>"What I've accomplished by {{todayMoment.format("MMM Do")}} of this year compared to previous years to the
			same date?"</i>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3 class="mat-title">How to display progression in imperial system unit?</h3>
		You will find a <i>"App system units"</i> option in <i>common settings</i>. Set it to <i>imperial</i> and go
		back to this page
